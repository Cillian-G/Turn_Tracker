            Welcome to Turn Tracker, an online tool that helps you keep your board game night on track. Turn Tracker 
            randomly selects a player to take the first turn, and will track whose turn it is throughout the game. 
            Turn Tracker also has a handy timer function, so you can keep track of how long the current player's turn 
            has lasted. At the end of your game, you'll get a tally of how much time each player spent taking their 
            turns, so you can finally work out which players are dragging their feet and slowing down the game!
        </p>

            If players are already seated, selecting this setting will pick a random first player and will follow a turn
