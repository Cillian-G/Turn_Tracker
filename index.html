            PLACEHOLDER TEXT Welcome to Turn Tracker, an online tool that helps you keep track of whose turn it is when playing board games.
            Turn Tracker also has a handy timer function, so you can keep track of how long the current player's turn has lasted.
            At the end of your game, you'll get a tally of how much time each player took over the course of the game, so you can finally
            work out which players are dragging their feet and slowing down the game!
        </p>

        <p>
